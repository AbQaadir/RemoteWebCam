## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email the maintainer directly or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

## Security Measures

This project prioritizes privacy and security:

- **Local-only communication**: All data stays on your local network
- **No cloud services**: No data is sent to external servers
- **No authentication stored**: The app doesn't store any credentials
- **Open source**: All code is publicly auditable

## Best Practices

When using RemoteWebCam:

1. Only connect devices on trusted networks
2. Be aware that the stream is not encrypted (HTTP, not HTTPS)
3. Don't use on public Wi-Fi networks
4. Close the app when not in use
